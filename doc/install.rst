Installation
============

OpenClimateGIS has a number of dependencies for geospatial, array, and data storage access and processing.

Linux Installation
------------------

A `bash script`_ is available containing a command structure for installing most of the OpenClimateGIS dependencies (no need to install PostGIS). There is currently no installer for OpenClimateGIS, and it must be installed from source_. Additional information on software dependencies may be found on the project's `CoG dependency page`_.

.. _bash script: https://github.com/NCPP/ocgis/blob/master/sh/install_geospatial.sh
.. _source: https://github.com/NCPP/ocgis
.. _CoG dependency page: http://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/openclimategis/dependencies

Other Platforms
---------------

OpenClimateGIS has not been tested on other platforms. All libraries are theoretically supported on Mac and Windows.
