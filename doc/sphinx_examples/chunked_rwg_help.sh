Usage: ocli chunked-rwg [OPTIONS]

  Generate regridding weights using a spatial decomposition.

Options:
  -s, --source PATH               Path to the source grid NetCDF file.
                                  [required]
  -d, --destination PATH          Path to the destination grid NetCDF file.
                                  [required]
  -n, --nchunks_dst TEXT          Single integer or sequence defining the
                                  chunking decomposition for the destination
                                  grid. Each value is the number of chunks
                                  along each decomposed axis. For unstructured
                                  grids, provide a single value (i.e. 100).
                                  For logically rectangular grids, two values
                                  are needed to describe the x and y
                                  decomposition (i.e. 10,20). Required if
                                  --genweights and not --spatial_subset.
  --merge / --no_merge            (default=merge) If --merge, merge weight
                                  file chunks into a global weight file.
  -w, --weight PATH               Path to the output global weight file.
                                  Required if --merge.
  --esmf_src_type TEXT            (default=GRIDSPEC) ESMF source grid type.
                                  Supports GRIDSPEC, UGRID, and SCRIP.
  --esmf_dst_type TEXT            (default=GRIDSPEC) ESMF destination grid
                                  type. Supports GRIDSPEC, UGRID, and SCRIP.
  --genweights / --no_genweights  (default=True) Generate weights using ESMF
                                  for each source and destination subset.
  --esmf_regrid_method TEXT       (default=CONSERVE) The ESMF regrid method.
                                  Only applicable with --genweights. Supports
                                  CONSERVE, BILINEAR. PATCH, and NEAREST_STOD.
  --spatial_subset / --no_spatial_subset
                                  (default=no_spatial_subset) Optionally
                                  subset the destination grid by the bounding
                                  box spatial extent of the source grid. This
                                  will not work in parallel if --genweights.
  --src_resolution FLOAT          Optionally overload the spatial resolution
                                  of the source grid. If provided, assumes an
                                  isomorphic structure. Spatial resolution is
                                  the mean distance between grid cell center
                                  coordinates.
  --dst_resolution FLOAT          Optionally overload the spatial resolution
                                  of the destination grid. If provided,
                                  assumes an isomorphic structure. Spatial
                                  resolution is the mean distance between grid
                                  cell center coordinates.
  --buffer_distance FLOAT         Optional spatial buffer distance (in units
                                  of the destination grid coordinates) to use
                                  when subsetting the source grid by the
                                  spatial extent of a destination grid or
                                  chunk. This is computed internally if not
                                  provided. Useful to override if the area of
                                  influence for a source-destination mapping
                                  is known a priori.
  --wd PATH                       Optional working directory for intermediate
                                  chunk files. Creates a directory in the
                                  system's temporary scratch space if not
                                  provided.
  --persist / --no_persist        (default=no_persist) If --persist, do not
                                  remove the working directory --wd following
                                  execution.
  --eager / --not_eager           (default=eager) If --eager, load all data
                                  from the grids into memory before
                                  subsetting. This will increase performance
                                  as loading data for each chunk is avoided.
                                  Set this to --not_eager for a more memory
                                  efficient execution at the expense of
                                  additional IO operations.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
